SortPal
This program allows the user to type in the number of maximum lines of words
he/she wishes to type in. After the user types them in, the program
will determine whether the lines of words are palindromes are not. It 
will output the list of palindromes and non-palindromes.

Creatures
This program will display an empty window with buttons. The user may create
creatures on the window by clicking the button of the creature the
user wants to create and then clicking the window. After user creates
two creatures, the simulation will automaticaly start running. The seeker
 will move to the closest creature. The bouncer will move around randomly.
 The escaper will move away from all the other creatures. User can also start,
 stop and, clear all the monsters from the window by clicking the buttons.

1. Java interfaces don't allow user to write method bodies, while abstract
 classes do. Another difference is that interfaces can only contain final
 variables, while abstract classes can also contain non-final variables.  

2. In both interfaces and abstract classes, user can declare abstract
 methods and neither can be instantiated. 

3. int[] a = new int [] {1,3,5,7,9}

4. To set the number of spaces, use :set shiftwidth=2 and to indent use N>>,
 where N is the number of lines you want to indent. To deindent, use N<<.

5. Use >% to dindent a block. To de-indent use <%.

6. 3 examples are: ananan, noon, and Sit on a potato pan.

7. Helper methods for parsing command line arguments must be static 
because they can be accessed by class that is instantiated.

8. Use vim *.txt

9. You can use mkdir -p fooDir/barDir

10. I still do my own work and if I run out of time I just turn in my 
assignment incomplete.
